### About

Software developer (researcher) with 15+ years of research and development experience, architecture designing and team leading. Currently, my primary focus is about systems software development, low-level programming and reverse code engineering as well as software exploitation methods.

Being a kernel developer I’m following Linux kernel development (since v2.4.28) and my favorite subsystem is NET, albeit I know well ARCH/X86, VFS, SECURITY and CRYPTO. By the [link](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/log/?qt=author&q=matvejchikov) you may find a list of upstream kernel commits I’ve made in the past.
